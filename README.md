BetterMOSS or, more like RobloxMOSS is a program inspired by MOSS and specifically meant for Roblox (https://nohope.eu).

It is alternatively better than MOSS for Roblox.

Program includes:

Timestamp of when processes were logged

Game detection

Signature Validation

SHA-256 File hash logging (instead of MOSS's SHA-2)

Windows Defender properly being flagged and is being scanned for every 60 seconds (Timestamp of Windows Defender's status).

Output of all the Roblox modules after 45 seconds upon launching the game.

Proper error handling (Yes, there will be errors for system files as the program doesn't have sufficient permissions to access those).

I made this for fun and it should be considered nothing serious, as this is GitHub account for fun stuff. :)
